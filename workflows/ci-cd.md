# Continuous Integration and Deployment Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines the CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) process for the Its Different Productions platform. The workflow covers code quality checks, testing, building, and deployment to various environments.

## Actors

- **Developer** - Person making code changes
- **GitHub Actions** - Automation service for CI/CD
- **Vercel** - Deployment platform
- **System** - The Its Different Productions platform

## Preconditions

- Code is hosted on GitHub
- GitHub Actions is configured
- Vercel project is set up and connected to the repository
- Environment variables are configured in GitHub Secrets and Vercel

## Steps

### 1. Code Changes

- Developer creates a feature branch from main
- Developer makes code changes
- Developer commits changes and pushes to GitHub
- Developer creates a pull request (PR) to merge into main

### 2. Continuous Integration

When a PR is created or updated, GitHub Actions automatically:

- Checks out the code
- Installs dependencies
- Runs linting checks
- Runs type checking
- Runs unit tests
- Runs integration tests (if applicable)
- Generates a test coverage report
- Checks for security vulnerabilities in dependencies

### 3. Preview Deployment

- When CI checks pass, Vercel automatically:
  - Builds the application
  - Deploys to a preview environment
  - Comments on the PR with the preview URL
- Developer and reviewers can test the changes in the preview environment

### 4. Code Review

- Other developers review the code changes
- Automated checks must pass before merging
- Reviewers approve the PR when ready

### 5. Merge to Main

- Developer merges the PR into the main branch
- GitHub Actions runs the CI process again on the main branch

### 6. Production Deployment

- When changes are merged to main, Vercel automatically:
  - Builds the application for production
  - Runs any production-specific optimizations
  - Deploys to the production environment
  - Runs smoke tests against the production deployment
- System monitors the deployment for any issues

### 7. Post-Deployment Verification

- System runs automated checks against the production environment
- Developer verifies critical functionality
- System monitors for any errors or performance issues

## Postconditions

- Code changes are deployed to production
- All tests pass in the production environment
- Documentation is updated (if applicable)
- Deployment is monitored for issues

## Error Handling

### CI Failures

- If any CI check fails:
  - GitHub Actions marks the check as failed
  - Developer is notified
  - PR cannot be merged until issues are fixed
  - Detailed error logs are available for debugging

### Deployment Failures

- If preview deployment fails:
  - Vercel reports the failure
  - PR is marked as having failed checks
  - Developer fixes the issues before proceeding

- If production deployment fails:
  - Vercel attempts to roll back to the previous version
  - Development team is notified immediately
  - Issue is prioritized for immediate resolution

### Post-Deployment Issues

- If issues are detected after deployment:
  - Development team is notified
  - Decision is made whether to roll back
  - Hotfix is developed and deployed through the same process

## Technical Implementation

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 8
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
          cache: 'pnpm'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install
      - name: Lint
        run: pnpm lint
      - name: Type check
        run: pnpm type-check
      - name: Test
        run: pnpm test
      - name: Build
        run: pnpm build

  # Deployment is handled by Vercel
```

### Vercel Configuration

```json
// vercel.json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/next"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/$1"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL": "@site_url"
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

- Secrets are stored in GitHub Secrets and Vercel Environment Variables
- Production deployments require passing all checks
- Code is scanned for security vulnerabilities
- Dependencies are regularly updated
- Access to deployment environments is restricted
